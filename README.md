# Creational Patterns

  1. Abstract Factory -	Creates an instance of several families of classes - 5
  2. Builder - Separates object construction from its representation - 2
  3. Factory - Method	Creates an instance of several derived classes - 5
  4. Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned - 3
  5. Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist - 4
  
  
# Structural Patterns

  1. Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes - 4
  2. Bridge -	Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation - 3
  3. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects - 4
  4. Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically - 3
  5. Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem - 5
  6. Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing - 1
  7. Proxy - An object representing another object - 4
  
  
# Behavioral Patterns

  1. Chain of Responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects - 2
  2. Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object - 4
  3. Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program - 1
  4. Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection - 5
  5. Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes - 2
  6. Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state - 1
  7. Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes - 5
  8. State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes - 3
  9. Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class - 4
  10. Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass - 3
  11. Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change - 1
